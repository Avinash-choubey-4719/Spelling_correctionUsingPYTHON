# Spelling_correctionUsingPYTHON
Correcting spelling mistakes is an integral part of writing in the modern world, whether it is part of texting a phone, sending an email,
writing large documents or searching for information on the web.

Modern spelling correctors aren’t perfect (indeed, automatic error correction is a popular source of fun on the web), 
but they’re ubiquitous in just about all software that relies on keyboard input.

Spelling correction is often viewed from two angles. Non-word spell check is the detection and correction of spelling mistakes that result in non-words. 
In contrast, real word spell checking involves detecting and correcting misspellings even if they accidentally result in a real English word (real word errors).

This can come from typographical errors of real-word errors (insertion, deletion, transposition) that accidentally produce a real word, or from cognitive errors
where the writer substituted the wrong one.
